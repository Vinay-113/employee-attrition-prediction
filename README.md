## 📄 Abstract
This project presents a comprehensive machine learning approach to predict employee attrition and estimate salaries using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. Leveraging multi-step classification and regression models, the pipeline analyzes key organizational features such as job role, performance, satisfaction, and income. Classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are used to identify potential attrition with high accuracy, while regression techniques like L...
The results demonstrate the potential of predictive analytics in enhancing HR decision-making, optimizing employee retention strategies, and aligning compensation with performance metrics.
